        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Verse 1</strong><br />
          She walks in, and the room feels light,<br />
          Nothing big, just something right.<br />
          Her laugh rings out, pulls me in,<br />
          Feels like home, like where I’ve been.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Chorus</strong><br />
          And just like that, it’s a better day,<br />
          Her easy smile lights up the way.<br />
          Not trying hard, not playing a part,<br />
          Just being her, that’s the best part.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verse 2</strong><br />
          She’s got this spark, hard to ignore,<br />
          A quiet strength, never forced.<br />
          Her eyes so clear, no need to hide,<br />
          Feels like calm in a world so wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bridge</strong><br />
          And just like that, it’s a better day,<br />
          Her easy smile lights up the way.<br />
          No grand parade, no fancy start,<br />
          Just being her, that’s the art.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Music]</strong><br /></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verse3</strong><br />
          Not out to change, no need to shine,<br />
          She’s herself, and that’s just fine.<br />
          Every word feels so real,<br />
          Something steady, something I feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Chorus</strong><br />
          And just like that, it’s a better day,<br />
          Her easy smile lights up the way.<br />
          No grand parade, no fancy start,<br />
          Just being her, that’s the art.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Music]</strong><br /></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bridge</strong><br />
          And just like that, things fall in place,<br />
          She’s got a way, a certain grace.<br />
          Nothing loud, no need to try,<br />
          Just being her, and that’s why.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Chorus</strong><br />
          And just like that, it’s a better day,<br />
          Her easy smile lights up the way.<br />
          No grand parade, no fancy start,<br />
          Just being her, that’s the best part.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Outro</strong><br />
          Not out to change, no need to shine,<br />
          She’s herself, and that’s just fine.<br />
          Every word feels so real,<br />
          Something steady, something I feel.
